# -hooked_slider-

This was a learning project based on this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0ZKwripZXg&list=WL&index=35

The initial tutorial made use of the Slick library and this project attempted to add functionality within that context, including adding background images, repositioning card elements, and adding transform/transition effects.

The duplicate set of cards at the bottom of the screen were my test cards without the Slider wrapper to make sure the changes I wanted to make actually worked on their own. This allowed me to track down issues when they didn't work initially in the slider. The only piece I am still trying to correct is the transform/transition effect on card hover which is obfuscated because the slider uses 'overflow: hidden' on its main div.
